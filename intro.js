JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users'
devices.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components
of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this
usage is Node.js.

JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
