JavaScript Notebook

Welcome to your JavaScript Notebook.  

This notebook is meant to provide a **very brief** introduction to important 
concepts within the *JavaScript* programming language.

This is NOT meant to serve as an all inclusive deep dive into JavaScript.

This course is a project based course and many aspects of the JavaScript language
will be addressed further within the projects.
